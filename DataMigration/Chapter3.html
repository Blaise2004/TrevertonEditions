            <p>
            Its outline flickers on the ground, glitching in and out, a half-formed shape trying to stitch itself back together.
            Patents whip through the air, slamming into its body, colours igniting as they lock into place like pieces of armour.
            With each one that connects, the thing grows heavier and stronger. A pressure swells outward from it, a mind reforming.
            
            I understand what is happening.
            And I understand what I have to do.
            I cannot let it finish.
            
            Acting on instinct, I throw myself forward and grab the creature itself. My hand closes around something warm and
            unstable, a body that is part code, part matter, trembling violently. It struggles in my grip, glitching, confused,
            incomplete. But I have it.
            
            The pull toward the centre intensifies, dragging at us, demanding the creature return and become whole. My feet slide
            across the white floor as more patents slice through the air toward us.
            
            I hold on even tighter.
            
            Then I see it. A crack in the brilliant white void, thin and dark, like a tear in a surface that was never meant to
            open. A way out.
            
            Without thinking, I run for it, clutching the half-formed bug to my chest as the world behind us stretches and bends,
            trying to pull us back.
            
            The moment I reach the crack, everything gives way.
            </p>
